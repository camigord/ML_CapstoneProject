# Deep Learning Capstone Project
## Udacity - Machine Learning Nanodegree - Capstone Project 

This is my capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. I implemented an application which detects, localizes and interprets number strings in real-world images.

A report describing the development of the current project can be found together with the code (*Capstone Project.pdf*)

I used [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to train the model, and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) to capture webcam frames.

All the code was implemented as Jupyter Notebooks (Python 2.7). The following is a description of each one of the available files:

- *1_CreateSyntheticData.ipynb:* 
> Generates Synthetic training samples by concatenating digits from the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. The code assumes that TensorFlow is installed and loads the data from its tutorials.

- *2_TrainSyntheticModel.ipynb*
- *3_Preprocess_SVHN.ipynb*
- *4_TrainingOnSVHN.ipynb*
- *5_Generate_Regression_Datasets.ipynb*
- *6_Train_Regression_Model.ipynb*
- *7_Evaluate_Models.ipynb*
